# Simon-Game
Built using HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery.

Simon is a memory game where each time a block of a particular color blinks which the player has to remember and then press all the colors from the beginning to get the next color.
If any of the colors pressed by the player are out of order then the game is over.

Current functionalities include:

A sound and animation that corresponds to each button plays both when the series of button presses plays, and when the player personally presses a button.
If a wrong block is pressed by the player then a sound is played and the game is over which can be restarted by pressing any button.
